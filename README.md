<h1>Task 0/Initializing</h1>
I started out by getting the data into Google Colab and imported the CSV file. Once i did this i set the dataframe equal to diabetes_data and i called the head to just get an idea of what kin of data that im working with.

Once i did that i looked ahade in the assingment and saw i had to set a seed value and the sample size for the data that we are getting the sample data for, so i next set the seed to 75, i wasnt sure what number to go with so i just went for the first number that came to my head. After that i set the sample value to 25 as it said in the assingment. This worked for the first 2 tasks but for the third task i saw my results were slightly off so i had to set the seed value to 75 again in my last bit of code.
